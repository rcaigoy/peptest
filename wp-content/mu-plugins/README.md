# Shipping Insurance Checkout Fix - MU-Plugin

**Version:** 1.2.2  
**Type:** Must-Use Plugin (Auto-loads, cannot be deactivated)  
**Purpose:** Fix critical timing and session issues with Shipping Insurance Manager plugin

---

## What This Plugin Does

This MU-plugin fixes multiple critical issues with the Shipping Insurance Manager plugin:

1. **Session Not Set on Initial Load** - Ensures default insurance selection is saved to WooCommerce session
2. **AJAX Clears Selection** - Protects against FunnelKit/WooFunnels AJAX updates clearing the insurance selection
3. **Race Conditions** - Handles timing issues between fee calculation and HTML rendering
4. **Cart Total Mismatch** - Forces cart recalculation after session restoration
5. **Validation Safety** - Revalidates insurance on cart changes, shipping changes, and inventory updates

---

## Why Use This Instead of Modifying the Plugin?

**Advantages:**
- ✅ **Update-Safe** - Survives Shipping Insurance Manager plugin updates
- ✅ **Auto-Loading** - Always active (MU-plugins load before regular plugins)
- ✅ **Non-Invasive** - Doesn't modify original plugin files
- ✅ **Defense-in-Depth** - Multiple hook points catch all timing scenarios

**Use Cases:**
- Production sites that auto-update plugins
- Sites where you can't guarantee manual re-application of fixes
- Additional protection layer on top of direct plugin fixes

---

## How It Works

### Multiple Hook Strategy

The plugin uses **7 different hook points** to ensure insurance is set correctly:

1. **Priority 5 - Early Cart Calculation**
   ```php
   woocommerce_cart_calculate_fees (priority 5)
   ```
   Runs before main plugin (priority 20) to set default

2. **Checkout Form Load**
   ```php
   woocommerce_before_checkout_form
   ```
   Sets default when checkout page first loads

3. **CRITICAL - Session Protection** ⭐
   ```php
   woocommerce_checkout_update_order_review (priority 15)
   ```
   Runs AFTER main plugin (priority 10) to detect and restore cleared sessions

4. **AJAX Updates**
   ```php
   woocommerce_checkout_update_order_review (priority 5)
   ```
   Handles FunnelKit/WooFunnels AJAX calls

5. **Before Payment Render**
   ```php
   woocommerce_review_order_before_payment
   ```
   Final safety check before payment section displays

6. **Safety Guards**
   - `woocommerce_cart_emptied` - Clears insurance when cart is emptied
   - `woocommerce_cart_updated` - Revalidates on cart changes
   - `woocommerce_after_shipping_rate_update` - Revalidates on shipping changes

7. **JavaScript Backup**
   - Client-side persistence in case server-side hooks miss something
   - Stores initial selection and restores if deselected

## The Critical v1.2.2 Fix

**What Changed:**

The main Shipping Insurance Manager plugin has a bug in `save_shipping_insurance_to_session()`:
```php
// BUG: Always sets session, even during AJAX calls that don't include the field
WC()->session->set('shipping_insurance_package', $insurance_value);
WC()->cart->calculate_totals();
```

When FunnelKit triggers `update_checkout` via AJAX, the insurance field isn't in POST data, so the plugin sets session to empty string `''`, clearing the selection.

**v1.2.2 Protection:**

This version adds `protect_session_from_clearing` hook at priority 15 (AFTER the main plugin runs at priority 10):

```php
public function protect_session_from_clearing($posted_data) {
    // Check if main plugin just cleared the session
    $current_session = WC()->session->get('shipping_insurance_package', null);
    
    if ($current_session === '' || $current_session === null) {
        // Check if this was a user choice or a bug
        if (!isset($output['shipping_insurance_package'])) {
            // No POST data = JS-triggered update (FunnelKit)
            // Restore the default selection
            $this->set_default_selection_to_session();
            
            // CRITICAL: Force recalculation
            // Main plugin already calculated WITHOUT insurance,
            // so we must recalculate WITH it
            WC()->cart->calculate_totals();
        }
    }
}
```

**Why This Works:**

1. Main plugin runs at priority 10, clears session, calculates totals
2. Our MU-plugin runs at priority 15, detects clearing, restores session
3. **NEW in v1.2.2:** We call `calculate_totals()` again to recalculate WITH the restored insurance
4. Result: Insurance stays selected and fee is included in total

**No configuration needed!** The plugin works automatically.

### Optional: Enable Debug Logging

Add to `wp-config.php`:
```php
define('WP_DEBUG', true);
define('WP_DEBUG_LOG', true);
define('WP_DEBUG_DISPLAY', false);
```

Then check `wp-content/debug.log` for detailed logging:
```
🔧 SHIPPING INSURANCE FIX: HOOK: protect_session_from_clearing (priority 15 - after main plugin)
🔧 SHIPPING INSURANCE FIX: ⚠️ Session cleared by main plugin (no insurance in POST data)
🔧 SHIPPING INSURANCE FIX: 🔧 This was JS-triggered update_checkout from FunnelKit - restoring insurance
🔧 SHIPPING INSURANCE FIX: ✅ Set default to session: 0
🔧 SHIPPING INSURANCE FIX: 🔄 Forcing cart recalculation to include restored insurance fee
🔧 SHIPPING INSURANCE FIX: ✅ Cart totals recalculated with insurance fee
```

### Browser Console Logging

Open browser console (F12) on checkout page:
```
🛡️ Shipping Insurance MU-Plugin v1.2.2 - JavaScript backup active
🔍 Checkout updated - Insurance radios found: 2
🔍 Checked radio value: 0
✅ Stored initial insurance selection: 0
```

## Testing

### Test Checklist

1. **Initial Load**
   - [ ] Go to checkout page
   - [ ] Insurance option should be pre-selected
   - [ ] Fee should be included in total immediately

2. **AJAX Update (Critical)**
   - [ ] Wait 3-5 seconds (FunnelKit triggers auto-update)
   - [ ] Insurance should STAY selected
   - [ ] Total should remain correct with insurance fee

3. **User Interaction**
   - [ ] Manually deselect insurance → fee should be removed
   - [ ] Manually re-select insurance → fee should be added back
   - [ ] Change shipping method → insurance should remain selected (if applicable)

4. **Cart Changes**
   - [ ] Add item to cart → insurance revalidates
   - [ ] Remove item → insurance revalidates
   - [ ] Empty cart → insurance selection cleared

### Debug Testing

With `WP_DEBUG` enabled:

1. Tail the log:
   ```bash
   tail -f wp-content/debug.log
   ```

2. Visit checkout page

3. Look for these messages:
   - `MU-Plugin v1.2.2 initialized - Full safety mode`
   - `Set default to session: [package_id]`
   - `Session cleared by main plugin` (if FunnelKit is active)
   - `Cart totals recalculated with insurance fee`

---

## Compatibility

### Required
- **WordPress:** 5.8+
- **WooCommerce:** 5.0+
- **Shipping Insurance Manager:** Any version

### Tested With
- WooCommerce 8.0 - 9.3
- FunnelKit (WooFunnels) 3.x
- Shipping Insurance Manager 1.0 - 1.5

### Known Conflicts
None known. Works alongside:
- WooCommerce checkout customizers
- Page builders (Elementor, Divi, etc.)
- Other shipping plugins

---

## Troubleshooting

### Insurance Still Not Selected

**Check 1: MU-Plugin Active?**
- Go to **Plugins** → **Must-Use**
- Verify "Shipping Insurance Checkout Fix" is listed

**Check 2: Insurance Packages Configured?**
- Go to **WooCommerce** → **Settings** → **Shipping Insurance**
- Ensure at least one package is enabled

**Check 3: PHP OpCache**
```bash
# Restart PHP to clear OpCache
sudo systemctl restart php-fpm
```

**Check 4: Debug Log**
```bash
# Enable WP_DEBUG and check logs
tail -f wp-content/debug.log | grep "INSURANCE"
```

### Fee Not Calculated

**Check 1: Session vs Variable Mismatch**

Add this to the main plugin's `add_shipping_insurance_fee()` method:
```php
error_log('Session value: ' . WC()->session->get('shipping_insurance_package', 'NOT SET'));
```

If you see "NOT SET", the session isn't being saved properly.

**Check 2: Main Plugin Updated?**

If the Shipping Insurance Manager was updated, check if they fixed the bug. If not, the MU-plugin should still work.

**Check 3: FunnelKit Timing**

Try disabling FunnelKit temporarily to isolate the issue.

### Total Correct Initially, Then Wrong

This was the bug in v1.2.1! **Upgrade to v1.2.2** which adds the second `calculate_totals()` call.

---

## Uninstallation

To remove this fix:

1. Delete the file:
   ```bash
   rm wp-content/mu-plugins/shipping-insurance-checkout-fix.php
   ```

2. Clear all caches

3. Test checkout to see if Shipping Insurance Manager works correctly without it

**Note:** If the main plugin bug still exists, you'll see the original issues return (insurance deselected after 3-4 seconds).

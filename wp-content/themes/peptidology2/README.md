## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Q: "Still slow after activation"**

   3. Browser hard reload (Ctrl+Shift+R)
   4. Wait 5 minutes for propagation
```

```
A: Clear transient cache:
   wp transient delete --all
   
   Or wait 24 hours for automatic rebuild
   
   Or set default attributes:
   Products → Edit → Variations → Set default size
```

**Q: "Site looks different"**
```
A: Browser cache issue:
   1. Hard reload (Ctrl+Shift+R)
   2. Clear browser cache completely
   3. Try incognito/private window
   4. Try different browser
```

**Q: "How do I know it's working?"**
```
A: Check query count:
   1. Install Query Monitor plugin
   2. Visit shop page
   3. Check bottom of page
   4. Should show 30-50 queries (not 1,700+)
```

# Immediate Fixes - Deploy Now

**Timeline:** 1-2 days  
**Risk:** Low  
**Impact:** 60x faster page loads  
**Recommendation:** Deploy immediately

---

## The Problem

**Shop page loads in 8-30 seconds** due to two critical issues:
1. Inefficient database queries (1,700+ per page)
2. All 50+ plugins loading on every page

---

## Fix #1: Double WP Loading Bugfix (Peptidology 2)

### What It Fixes
- **Removes 1,700 database queries** from shop page
- **Changes load time from 8-30s to 0.5-1.5s**
- **97% reduction in database overhead**

### The Problem
Original code called an expensive function (`get_available_variations()`) inside a loop, triggering 60-100 queries per product Ã— 38 products = 2,280+ queries.

### The Solution
Use default attributes already loaded in memory (0 queries per product) + caching.

### Deployment
1. Activate Peptidology 2 theme
2. Clear all caches
3. Test checkout works
4. Monitor for 1 week

**Status:** âœ… Ready to deploy  
**Files Changed:** 2 theme files  
**Rollback:** Instant (switch back to old theme)

## Fix #2: Conditional Plugin Loading (MU-Plugin)

### What It Fixes
- **20-30% additional performance gain**
- **Loads only necessary plugins per page**
- **Homepage: 15 fewer plugins loaded**

### How It Works
**Three loading strategies:**

| Strategy | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| ðŸŸ¢ **AlwaysOn** | Loads everywhere | WooCommerce, ACF |
| ðŸ”´ **AlwaysOff** | Never loads | Unused plugins |
| ðŸŸ¡ **Dynamic** | Loads when needed | Payment gateways (checkout only) |

**Current Configuration:**
- 26 plugins: AlwaysOn (core functionality)
- 24 plugins: Dynamic (conditional)
- 0 plugins: AlwaysOff (can configure as needed)

### Results by Page
- Homepage: 12-16 plugins skipped â†’ **24-32% faster**
- Shop: 8-10 plugins skipped â†’ **16-20% faster**
- Product: 5-8 plugins skipped â†’ **10-16% faster**
- Checkout: 0 plugins skipped â†’ **All needed (safe)**

### Deployment
1. Upload MU-plugin file
2. Test all pages (especially checkout)
3. Monitor for 2 weeks
4. Adjust strategies as needed

**Status:** ðŸ’¡ Deploy after Fix #1 is stable  
**Timeline:** 2-4 weeks after Fix #1  
**Rollback:** Instant (rename file)

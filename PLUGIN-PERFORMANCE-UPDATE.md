## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Always test in CONFIGURED mode** for real-world performance
2. **Use ALL ON mode** to temporarily enable Query Monitor for debugging
3. **Cache warmup is essential** - visit pages 2-3 times before timing
4. **Monitor security** - We kept Security Audit Log for compliance
5. **Comments are still technically enabled** - Consider fully disabling them in WordPress settings

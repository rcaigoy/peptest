## 💡 Tips for Success

### Make It Easy to Navigate

1. **Start with Executive Summary** - easiest to understand
2. **Use clear headings** - Heading 1, Heading 2, Heading 3
3. **Add visuals** - screenshots and videos tell the story
4. **Link between docs** - easy navigation
5. **Keep it simple** - client doesn't need all technical details

### Focus on These Key Points

1. **Problem was severe** (1,700 queries, 8-30s loads)
2. **Solution is ready** (Peptidology 2, thoroughly tested)
3. **Risk is low** (easy rollback, identical appearance)
4. **Benefit is huge** (60x faster, better UX)
5. **Action is clear** (deploy Peptidology 2 now)

### Answer These Questions

Your documentation should answer:
- ✅ What was the problem?
- ✅ What did you test?
- ✅ What's the recommendation?
- ✅ How do we deploy it?
- ✅ What's the risk?
- ✅ What's the ROI?

All 9 documents together answer these comprehensively.
